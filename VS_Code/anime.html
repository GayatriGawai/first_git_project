                >A high school loner is given the part-time job of a lifetime as
                a modern day ninja tasked to perform international
                assassinations. After World War II, Allied Command in Japan
                developed a new agency to help manage terrorism and violence
                within the Pacific region. The agency was staffed with ninja and
                they were initially tasked to handle domestic affairs.
                Eventually that program grew to its current form, managing
                20,000 ninja across a range of domestic and international
                affairs. One of those ninjas happens to be Kudo.

                back in time to his early days of studying magic at the
                prestigious Hebrion Academy! With this rare second chance, Desir

                    ><b>One Piece:</b></a
                >Barely surviving in a barrel after passing through a terrible
                whirlpool at sea, carefree Monkey D. Luffy ends up aboard a ship
                under attack by fearsome pirates. Despite being a naive-looking
                teenager, he is not to be underestimated. Unmatched in battle,
                Luffy is a pirate himself who resolutely pursues the coveted One
                Piece treasure and the King of the Pirates title that comes with
                it. The late King of the Pirates, Gol D. Roger, stirred up the
                world before his death by disclosing the whereabouts of his
                hoard of riches and daring everyone to obtain it. Ever since
                then, countless powerful pirates have sailed dangerous seas for
                the prized One Piece only to never return. Although Luffy lacks
                a crew and a proper ship, he is endowed with a superhuman
                ability and an unbreakable spirit that make him not only a
                formidable adversary but also an inspiration to many. As he
                faces numerous challenges with a big smile on his face, Luffy
                gathers one-of-a-kind companions to join him in his ambitious
                endeavor, together embracing perils and wonders on their
                once-in-a-lifetime adventure.

                    ><b>Jujutsu Kaisen 2nd Season:</b></a
                >The year is 2006, and the halls of Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu
                High School echo with the endless bickering and intense debate
                between two inseparable best friends. Exuding unshakeable
                confidence, Satoru Gojou and Suguru Getou believe there is no
                challenge too great for young and powerful Special Grade
                sorcerers such as themselves. They are tasked with safely
                delivering a sensible girl named Riko Amanai to the entity whose
                existence is the very essence of the jujutsu world. However, the
                mission plunges them into an exhausting swirl of moral conflict
                that threatens to destroy the already feeble amity between
                sorcerers and ordinary humans. Twelve years later, students and
                sorcerers are the frontline defense against the rising number of
                high-level curses born from humans' negative emotions. As the
                entities grow in power, their self-awareness and ambition
                increase too. The curses unite for the common goal of
                eradicating humans and creating a world of only cursed energy
                users, led by a dangerous, ancient cursed spirit. To dispose of
                their greatest obstacle—the strongest sorcerer, Gojou—they
                orchestrate an attack at Shibuya Station on Halloween. Dividing
                into teams, the sorcerers enter the fight prepared to risk
                everything to protect the innocent and their own kind.

                >After graduating from a top university with an impressive
                extracurricular record in the rugby club, Akira Tendou has
                nailed every step of the way to securing his dream job. On top
                of that, a beautiful and kind co-worker always brightens his day
                in the office! Life seems to be going very well for Akira until
                he slowly realizes that sleepless nights and brutal work are his
                new reality. Due to three years of mind-numbing labor in an
                exploitative company, Akira is unable to recognize the tired,
                unaccomplished person he has become. On track to losing all
                passion in life like several of his overworked colleagues, Akira
                finds his saving grace in the most unexpected way possible—the
                breakout of a zombie apocalypse. With the free time he finally
                has, Akira decides to complete a bucket list of a hundred things
                he wants to do before he eventually gets turned into a zombie.
                Although he is surrounded by the dead, Akira has never felt more
                alive!

                    ><b>Dark Gathering:</b></a
                >Keitarou Gentouga is a college freshman who hates ghosts.
                Unluckily for him, he has a knack for attracting spirits. Two
                years ago, this connection had led to him receiving a spiritual
                injury on his right hand, with his friend getting caught in the
                crossfire. The event caused him to become a shut-in, leaving him
                with very poor social skills. Fortunately, Keitarou is slowly
                starting to mingle with society, thanks to the help of his
                childhood friend, Eiko Houzuki. As part of his rehabilitation,
                Keitarou takes on the part-time job of a private tutor, and his
                first pupil is none other than Eiko's cousin, Yayoi Houzuki.
                Besides being a child prodigy, there is another peculiarity
                regarding Yayoi—she has a spiritual constitution, just like
                Keitarou. However, in contrast to Keitarou, she yearns to
                encounter spirits, hoping to find the ghost that took her mother
                away. As Keitarou is dragged along by Yayoi and Eiko to haunted
                spots, his part-time job seems to be straying further and
                further away from its original purpose.

                "Gluttony," he is ever starving, never sated... until the day he
                kills a dying thief and devours the man's strength—and his soul.
                The true hunger of Fate's Gluttony has awakened, and if he can
                learn to control his power, he will at last be the master of his
                own destiny.
